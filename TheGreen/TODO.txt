SpawnTile
Add an entity that tracks if a player placed a tile in it, and if so, set the spawn point to the players current position

Fixes:
Fix Door collision automatic closing so it works in both directions
design better damage system
Implement tile culling

Features:

projectiles
Ambitious Features:
Split Screen

UI: 
if inventory was open on death, reopen it when you respawn
draw map to a render target2D the size of the map. 
Only draw to this render target when the map is updated, and draw the pixels at the coresponding positions.
