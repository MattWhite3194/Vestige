TODO:

Finish as a tech demo:
add flowers, add iron and furnace to craft weapons, add entity spawning system

Some form of smart cursor

Get rid of treetop tile, move texture into tree and edit the draw function, Vector2 TreeTopOffset

Make Entity/NPC scope knockback function. Fix when it's applied

Refactor Items
split properties into interfaces and create new Item classes from those. default Item class will be bare bones - Texture, image, description, stackable, maxStack.
