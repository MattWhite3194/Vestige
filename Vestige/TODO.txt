TODO:

Add a TileScanner object that will scan all the tiles in view and pass scanned data to each object that needs it, reduces number of times tiles need to be sanned per frame to one. LightManager, TileDrawing, WallDrawing, etc...
This might not work for drawing...
Use for detecting active biome

Finish as a tech demo:
add flowers, add iron and furnace to craft weapons, add entity spawning system

Some form of smart cursor

Walls: -75 on brightness photo editor (future reference)

Get rid of treetop tile, move texture into tree and edit the draw function, Vector2 TreeTopOffset
Stairs

Make Entity/NPC scope knockback function. Fix when it's applied

Refactor Items
split properties into interfaces and create new Item classes from those. default Item class will be bare bones - Texture, image, description, stackable, maxStack.

Up Next:
Make WorldGen cooler
Add different biomes (either as part of one map, or dedicate an entire map to one biome (preferred))
Add stars and clouds, fix the ugly mountains texture

SpawnTile

Fixes:
design better damage system
Implement tile culling

Features:
add equipment (maybe make accessories input handlers, and store them in a list and call them before calling the players input)
Ambitious Features:
Split Screen

UI: 
if inventory was open on death, reopen it when you respawn
