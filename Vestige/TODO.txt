Add Map

Up Next:
Make WorldGen cooler
Add different biomes (either as part of one map, or dedicate an entire map to one biome (preferred))
Add stars and clouds, fix the ugly mountains texture

SpawnTile
Add an entity that tracks if a player placed a tile in it, and if so, set the spawn point to the players current position

Fixes:
Fix Door collision automatic closing so it works in both directions
design better damage system
Implement tile culling

Features:
add equipment (maybe make accessories input handlers, and store them in a list and call them before calling the players input)
projectiles
Ambitious Features:
Split Screen

UI: 
if inventory was open on death, reopen it when you respawn
draw map to a render target2D the size of the map. 
Only draw to this render target when the map is updated, and draw the pixels at the coresponding positions.

player inventory and world are tied together
